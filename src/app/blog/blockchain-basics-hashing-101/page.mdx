# Blockchain Basics: Hashing 101

So what even is hashing?

Hashing is one of those core ideas in cryptography and blockchain that sounds more complicated than it actually is. Part of the confusion comes from the terminology. For example, it would be accurate to say:

>A hash function hashes data to produce a hash.

But that is just downright confusing. So what does this actually mean?

A hash function takes an input of any sizeâ€”whether itâ€™s a string of text, a number, or an entire fileâ€”and runs it through an algorithm to produce a fixed-length output, known as a hash (also called a **message digest**).

>Think of it like a super-complicated blenderâ€”you throw in any data, and it gets scrambled into a completely different-looking string of characters. But unlike a real blender, if you put the exact same input in, you will always get the same output.

At first, this might sound abstract, but once you see it in action, it makes perfect sense. In this post, we'll break down hashing in a way that's more digestable. We'll show how a small change in input completely alters the output, and explain why itâ€™s a critical piece of any blockchain.

## What is Hashing?

A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input, scrambles it, and produces a fixed-length output called a hash. The key properties of a good hash function are:

- **One-way:** You cannot reverse-engineer the original input from the hash (message digest).

- **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same hash.

- **Small input change = completely different output:** Even the tiniest difference in input drastically changes the hash.

- **Fixed-length output:** No matter the size of the input, the hash is always the same length.

- **Fast computation:** Hash functions are designed to be computed quickly.

- **Different from encryption:** Hashing has no decryption keyâ€”itâ€™s not meant to be reversed.

## The Avalanche Effect: Small Changes, Big Differences

A key property of cryptographic hashes is that a tiny change in input completely changes the output. This is called the **avalanche effect**.

Letâ€™s take three similar words and hash them using SHA-256:

<CodeBlock>
"cat"  =>  77af778b51abd4a3c51c5ddd97204a9c3ae614ebccb75a606c3b6865aed6744e  
"hat"  =>  18e1dd392168f601d0e568612a2bf40e6555c033e033b580ae6627d8aeee1150  
"bat"  =>  ca5bcec12f716f44d9745d349cc80422f0d14cbab09329caf533bef7c2d952eb  
</CodeBlock>

Even though the inputs are **almost identical**, their hash outputs are **completely different**. This makes hash functions extremely useful for **detecting even the smallest changes in input data**.

## Hashing in Bitcoin: Transaction IDs

Hashing is **fundamental** to Bitcoin and is used in multiple ways:

- **Transaction Hashing** creates unique identifiers (TxIDs or fingerprints) for each transaction.  
- **Merkle Trees** organize and efficiently verify transactions.  
- **Proof of Work (Mining)** requires solving SHA-256 puzzles to secure the network.  
- **Block Hashing** links blocks together to form the blockchain.  
- **Bitcoin Addresses** are derived from hashed public keys.  

This post will focus on **transaction hashing**, a core mechanism that ensures Bitcoinâ€™s security and integrity.  

In Bitcoin (or any blockchain), every transaction is **hashed** to create a **unique signature**. What makes this powerful is that each transaction includes the **hash of the previous transaction**, forming an unbreakable chain.

### Example: How Transaction Hashing Works

Letâ€™s look at a simplified example with fake Bitcoin addresses to see this in action. Our fake Bitcoin transaction will include:  

- **Sender:** `bc1qgdjqv0av3q5`  
- **Receiver:** `bc1ql49ydapnjaf`  
- **Amount:** `0.5 BTC`  
- **Timestamp:** `1640995200` (Unix time)  
- **Previous Transaction Hash:** `6da0633528deaa0144e7b058315f0b753ec0b945163a72bf96a0d18180f9de0d`  
- **Other Details:** (Not shown here for simplicity's sake)

These values are combined and formatted into a structured transaction, then hashed. The simplified idea is:

<CodeBlock>
Sender + Receiver + Amount + Timestamp + Previous Hash

=

<span className="text-red-400">bc1qgdjqv0av3q5</span><span className="text-green-400">bc1ql49ydapnjaf</span><span className="text-blue-400">0.5</span><span className="text-yellow-400">1640995200</span><span className="text-purple-500">6da0633528deaa0144e7b058315f0b753ec0b945163a72bf96a0d18180f9de0d</span>
</CodeBlock>

Now, letâ€™s hash it with SHA-256. You can try it yourself using an online SHA-256 calculator [here](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html). 

We get the result:

<CodeBlock>
dea4b5ec10c7a4c11cbb0a6f85bc1ad4c3cda4d8ecf0a24b4c37509e5c758b19
</CodeBlock>

This **transaction hash (TxID)** serves as a **unique fingerprint** for the transaction. Even the smallest change to the transaction details would produce an entirely different hash, making tampering immediately detectable.


<Alert variant="info" title="Bitcoin Uses Double Hashing">
  Bitcoin doesn't just hash transactions **once** the way we did hereâ€”it applies SHA-256 **twice**. This algorithm is known as SHA-256d.  
  This extra step helps protect against **length extension attacks**, which SHA-256 alone can be vulnerable to.
</Alert>

## Hashing in Blocks: The Chain in Blockchain  

Just like transactions, **blocks** are also hashed. Every blockâ€™s header includes the **hash of the previous block**, ensuring that the entire blockchain remains **immutable**. If any transaction or block is altered, its hash changes, breaking the chainâ€”making fraud **impossible** without re-mining all subsequent blocks.  

Hashing is what puts the **"chain" in blockchain**â€”a sequence of cryptographically linked blocks that form a **tamper-proof** ledger... Stretching all the way back to the **Genesis block**, the first block of transactions ever mined.

## Other Uses for Hashing

Hashing isnâ€™t just for blockchainâ€”itâ€™s everywhere in computer science. From organizing data in software development to securing sensitive information, hashing is a fundamental tool that keeps systems efficient, reliable, and secure.

Beyond blockchain, it plays a crucial role in:

### **Password Storage**
Websites store hashed passwords instead of plaintext ones. When you log in, the password you enter is hashed, and the system compares the result to the stored hash. If they match, access is granted.

This is why your email provider can verify your password but canâ€™t retrieve it if you forget itâ€”because **they store only the hash, not the actual password.**

### **File Integrity Checks**
Hashes ensure files **havenâ€™t been tampered with** after download. Since files are just sequences of bits, they can be hashed like any other data.

If even a **single bit** of a file is altered, its hash **completely changes**, making tampering instantly detectable.

### **Digital Signatures**
Hashing is used to **verify authenticity** in digital signatures. When you sign a document online, the system hashes the documentâ€™s contents and uses cryptography to create a unique signature.

Later, anyone can verify the signature by checking that the document still produces the same hash, proving it hasnâ€™t been altered.

## Wrapping Up

Hashing is a core building block of cryptography and blockchain. It ensures data integrity, security, and uniqueness. As weâ€™ve seen, itâ€™s what makes the "chain" in blockchain. Hopefully it feels a little less like magic now.
