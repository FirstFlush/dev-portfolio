# What is TDD?

**Test Driven Development (TDD)** flips the usual workflow.  
Instead of building a feature and testing it later, you start by writing the test *first*. 

Why?

Because writing the test first forces you to define what “done” actually looks like.
It makes you clarify the goal before you start hacking toward a solution.
Instead of wandering your way into something that feels right, you're anchoring yourself to a concrete definition of success.

### The process:

1. Write a failing test that defines what success looks like.
2. Write just enough code to pass that test.
3. Refactor if needed. Repeat.

TDD is especially powerful when:
- You know exactly what “correct” output should look like.
- You’re *not* sure how to build the system to get there.
- You want to avoid writing messy, untested logic.

## Who Invented It?

TDD comes from **Extreme Programming (XP)**, a development methodology from the late ’90s.  
It was popularized by **Kent Beck**, who also created JUnit.

The core idea wasn’t just about writing clean code.  
It was about:
- Getting fast feedback
- Reducing bugs
- Building confidence when refactoring or expanding your codebase

## Why I Actually Used It (And Why I’m Sold)

I used TDD in **Street Ninja**, a nonprofit project that helps homeless people in Vancouver find food, shelter, and hygiene services via SMS.

### The Challenge

I needed to build a **message parser** for Street Ninja that could understand natural-language SMS messages like:

- `food 950 e broadway`
- `950 broadway st i need food`
- `950 broadway e food`
- `i need some food and i am near main st at 950 broadway plz help`
- `looking for a meal im 950 broadway st e thank you`
- `need food at broadway 950 east`

All of those messages are asking for the same thing:  
**food at 950 Broadway St E**.

A human gets that instantly.  
But a computer? Not so much.

People text in unpredictable ways—partial addresses, weird phrasing, typos, unit numbers, hashtags, polite filler, rambling, etc.  
It’s not structured input, but the intent is clear.

So how do you build a parser that can reliably extract:
1. The resource being requested (e.g. food, shelter)
2. The location (address or intersection)
3. Optional filters (e.g. wheelchair accessible, takeout)

And more importantly—how do you build that parser **with confidence** that it’s doing the right thing?

This is where TDD becomes a game-changer.

Instead of coding blindly and *hoping* it works, I started with the test cases. Using Python and pytest, I defined my test data's shape:

```python
@dataclass
class InquirySample:
    message: str
    location: ResolvedLocation
    keyword_and_language: ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage
    params: Optional[ParamDict] = field(default_factory=ParamDict)

@dataclass
class ResolvedLocation:
    location: str
    location_type: LocationType

@dataclass
class ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage:
    sms_keyword_enum: SMSKeywordEnum
    language_enum: LanguageEnum

@dataclass
class ParamDict:
    params: dict[ParamKeyEnum, ParamValueEnum] = field(default={})
```

Then I created a bunch of test cases.
That might sound like a pain—and sometimes it is—but tools like ChatGPT make it easy to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of examples that fit your data structure.

That said: **don’t blindly copy and paste**.
You absolutely need to review each one to make sure it’s accurate before using it in your tests.

Seriously—don’t skip that step.
Bad test data leads to bad assumptions, and then you’re just validating the wrong behavior with confidence.

My test data was defined as follows:

```python
FOOD_TEST_DATA = [
    InquirySample(
        message="420 Main St hungry",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("420 Main St", LocationType.ADDRESS),
    ),
    InquirySample(
        message="#3-224 E 10th Ave breakfast",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("224 E 10th Ave", LocationType.ADDRESS),
    ),
    InquirySample(
        message="any food near #212-104 W Cordova?",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("104 W Cordova", LocationType.ADDRESS),
    ),
    InquirySample(
        message="hungry at main and hastings",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("main and hastings", LocationType.INTERSECTION),
    ),
    InquirySample(
        message="wheelchair accessible food 450 Powell St",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("450 Powell St", LocationType.ADDRESS),
        params=ParamDict({
            FoodParamKey.WHEELCHAIR: BooleanParamValue.TRUE
        }),
    ),
    InquirySample(
        message="takeout meals near 789 Broadway",
        keyword_and_language=ResolvedKeywordAndLanguage(SMSKeywordEnum.FOOD, LanguageEnum.ENGLISH),
        location=ResolvedLocation("789 Broadway", LocationType.ADDRESS),
        params=ParamDict({
            FoodParamKey.TAKEOUT: BooleanParamValue.TRUE,
            FoodParamKey.MEALS: BooleanParamValue.TRUE
        }),
    ),
    # etc.............
]
```

Each test defines what the correct result should be.
The structure is simple and human-readable—but precise enough to validate parsing logic programmatically.

This is the core of why TDD worked so well for this:
> I didn’t know exactly how to build the logic…
> But I did know what correct output looked like.

So I wrote out a bunch of these test cases.  
Ran them.  
Watched them all fail (as expected).  
Then I got to work, building the parsing system piece by piece, shaping it around the test cases like a mold.

Every time a new test passed, I knew the system was getting smarter.  
Every time I refactored, the tests gave me instant feedback if I broke something.

TDD didn’t just help me build the right system—  
It helped me build it with confidence.

### The result?

- The location parser got much more accurate
- Refactoring was stress-free
- I could confidently expand logic without breaking stuff

TDD *literally* guided me toward the right implementation, despite me having no idea how to get there.

## You Don’t Have to Go All-In

TDD isn’t some sacred vow you have to take throughout your entire project.
You don’t need to write *every* part of your app this way. There's going to be certain areas where it shines and there's going to be other areas where it slows you down.

Here’s the real takeaway:

> If you find yourself in a spot where defining **correct behavior** is easier than figuring out the logic to get there…  
> TDD might be a good option for you.

Just use it where it makes sense.  
You don’t need to be a “TDD dev.”  
You just need to know when it can help.

Sometimes, clarity starts with a bunch of failing tests.
