## How Street Ninja Works  

Using Street Ninja is simple. Just **send a text** with what you need and your location, and you'll get back a list of the nearest resources—**no apps, no waiting on hold, no hassle**.  

### **Example Workflow**  

1. **Text "FOOD Main & Pender"**  
   - 📍 You get a list of nearby food programs.  

2. **Need more options?**  
   - Text **"MORE"** to see additional locations.  

3. **Want details about a specific place?**  
   - Text **"INFO 3"** to get more details about a specific result. This is especially useful for food programs, which have a lot of details associated with the. 

4. **Need step-by-step directions?**  
   - Text **"DIRECTIONS 3"** to get step-by-step walking directions.  

### **What You Can Find**  
- 🏠 **SHELTER** – Find nearby shelters with available beds.  
- 🍽 **FOOD** – Get locations of meal programs and food banks.  
- 🚻 **TOILET** – Locate public washrooms.  
- 🚰 **WATER** – Find drinking fountains.  
- 📶 **WIFI** – See free public WiFi hotspots.  

### **Filtering Your Search**  

Not every shelter is the same. Some are only for women. Some allow pets. Some food programs give out hampers instead of meals.  

Street Ninja lets people **refine their search** by adding simple filters to their request. If someone needs a **women’s-only shelter**, a **youth shelter**, or one that **allows pets**, they can include that in their text, and the system will filter the results accordingly.  

The goal is to make sure people don’t just get **any** resource, but the **right** one for their situation.  
If you ever get stuck, just text **"HELP"** for a list of available commands.

Street Ninja is designed to be **as intuitive as possible**—you don’t need to remember exact keywords. Whether you text **"meal," "breakfast," "lunch," or just "hungry,"** the system understands.
