## **What’s Ahead for Street Ninja**  

Right now, Street Ninja is focused on **helping people in Vancouver**, but the need for this kind of tool isn’t limited to one city. The long-term vision is to **expand to other cities**, integrating **local resource data** and making Street Ninja a tool that **anyone, anywhere** can use.  

### **Building a Smarter System with Machine Learning**  

So far, Street Ninja’s **location parsing** is rule-based—it follows **patterns and heuristics** to extract locations from messy text. But what if it could **learn and adapt** based on real-world usage?  

I’m currently exploring **machine learning-powered Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to improve how Street Ninja understands **locations, keywords, and intent**. Instead of relying only on **hardcoded rules**, the system could learn from **thousands of real user interactions** and become **better at handling ambiguous or unconventional phrasing.**  

This means in the future, Street Ninja could:  
- **Recognize location names more accurately, even with typos or incomplete input.**  
- **Understand intent better**, distinguishing between “water” as a keyword vs. a street name.  
- **Improve its responses over time** as more queries are processed.  

### **Scaling Up & Getting Support**  

Right now, Street Ninja **runs entirely on free-tier services**—which works, but comes with limits. Expanding the project would mean:  
- **Better geocoding & directions** (paid API plans have higher accuracy).  
- **More reliable SMS capacity** (free-tier Twilio has hard limits).  
- **Stronger infrastructure** to handle growth.  

The goal isn’t just to **keep this running**—it’s to **make it better, smarter, and more available to the people who need it most**.
